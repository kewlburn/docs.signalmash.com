API Keys authentication (also known as token authentication) is the authentication method used by Signalmash APIs. Signalmash supports standard token authentication methods for installed, client-side, web server, and mobile applications.

Obtain API token credentials from the Signalmash Portal to get started. Then, your client application asks the Signalmash API login for an access token, takes a session token out of the response, and sends it to the Signalmash API you want to access.

### Basic Authentication Steps

#### 1. Obtain API token credentials from Signalmash Portal.

To get token credentials, such as a **API KEY** that are known to both Signalmash and your application, go to the Signalmash Portal (go to the API Menu and select "[Tokens](https://portal.signalmash.com/#/api/tokens)" from the submenu).

#### 2. Include the API KEY in header when requesting to an API endpoints.

For endpoints authentication, you will use your Signalmash API KEY as your Authorization token.

```bash
$ curl -X GET \

```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab title = "PHP" >}}

```PHP
<?php
    echo 'lorem ipsum.';
?>
```

```json
# Response
{
    "data": [],
    "message": "Campaign Fetched Successfully!",
    "status": 200
}
```

### Revoking API Token

An application's access may occasionally be revoked by a user. By visiting Signalmash Portal, selecting "[Tokens](https://portal.signalmash.com/#/api/tokens)" from the submenu, and clicking the delete icon, a user can revoke access.
