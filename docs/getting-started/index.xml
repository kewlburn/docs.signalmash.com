Signalmash supports standard token authentication methods for installed, client-side, web server, and mobile application applications.
Obtain API token credentials from the Signalmash Portal to get started. Then, your client application asks the Signalmash API for an access token, takes a session token out of the response, and sends it to the Signalmash API you want to access.</description></item></channel></rss>
