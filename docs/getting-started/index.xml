Signalmash supports standard token authentication methods for installed, client-side, web server, and mobile application applications.
Obtain API token credentials from the Signalmash Portal to get started. Then, your client application asks the Signalmash API login for an access token, takes a session token out of the response, and sends it to the Signalmash API you want to access.</description></item></channel></rss>
