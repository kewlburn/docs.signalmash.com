This is the place to find official information on how to use Signalmash services and products in your app.
This site provides comprehensive documentation for all of our APIs and you’ll find everything you need to know about working with a particular API in the corresponding section.
However, there are some fundamental concepts that you need to understand and tools that might help you that apply across all our APIs. Here, we\u0026rsquo;ll give you this information and get you up and running as quickly as possible.
What you will learn: # Signing up for an account Accessing API Token information Experimenting with our APIs Working with Webhooks Concepts Signing up for an account # To work with our APIs, you will need to sign up for an account. This will give you an API token and key that you can use to access our APIs.
Accessing API Token information # Every API request authenticates the user, which you may do through the user\u0026rsquo;s site by creating tokens. Users can now use the same or different tokens for each activity they make, thanks to a single management location.
Log in to the portal, then go to the API Menu and select \u0026ldquo;Tokens\u0026rdquo; from the submenu. To make a token, go to the right upper corner and click \u0026ldquo;Add Token.\u0026rdquo; There will be a pop-up window. Choose the function (s) to link to the token.
Authentication # When using the Signalmash APIs your requests need to be authenticated. Typically this is done using Bearer Authentication.
Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens.
The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources:
Authorization: Bearer \u0026lt;token\u0026gt;
Experimenting with our APIs # Ultimately, you’re going to want to build an app in your chosen programming language. But to start with, you might want to make some sample requests to our APIs to check that you have provided the correct parameters and that you are getting back the responses you want.
If you are familiar with the command-line tool Curl, you will find Curl snippets for each of our APIs that you can copy, paste and modify.
Postman # Various GUI tools exist that are easier to use than Curl. A popular one is Postman. Signalmash also provides a set of Postman collections, which provides a way to start using the APIs immediately.

Basic Authentication Steps # 1. Obtain API token credentials from Signalmash Portal. # Visit the Signalmash Portal (go to the API Menu and select \u0026ldquo;Tokens\u0026rdquo; from the submenu) to obtain token credentials such as a Token Name and API key that are known to both Signalmash and your application.
2. Obtain a session token from Signalmash API login. # Revoking API Token # In some cases a user may wish to revoke access given to an application. A user can revoke access by visiting Signalmash Portal (go to the API Menu and select \u0026ldquo;Tokens\u0026rdquo; from the submenu) and click the delete icon.
